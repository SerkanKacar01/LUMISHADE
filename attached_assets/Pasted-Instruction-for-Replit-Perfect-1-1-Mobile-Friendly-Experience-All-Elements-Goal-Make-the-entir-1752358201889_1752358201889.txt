✅ Instruction (Component by Component)
	1.	Product Images on Mobile
	•	Scale all product preview images to fit within 100% width with max height around 180–200px.
	•	Maintain aspect ratio and apply slight border-radius (optional) for clean visuals.
	•	Never let image height exceed the screen viewport.
	2.	Text Blocks (Titles, Descriptions, Prices)
	•	Product titles: 16–18px bold
	•	Subtitles/descriptions: max 14px regular
	•	Price: slightly larger, centered or left-aligned (17–18px)
	•	Ensure line-height and margins are tight to reduce vertical space
	3.	CTA Buttons (“View Details”, “Add to Cart”)
	•	Set buttons to full width (or 90% max)
	•	Minimum height: 44px
	•	Use consistent padding and slightly reduce vertical margin between cards
	4.	Product Cards (Overview Pages)
	•	Reduce vertical padding and space between each product card
	•	Limit each card to max 320px high including image, title, price, and button
	5.	Navigation Menu (Header and Burger Menu)
	•	Ensure burger menu opens cleanly with minimal animation delay
	•	Keep menu items vertically stacked with clear tap targets (min height: 40px)
	•	Add scroll to long dropdowns if needed
	6.	Product Detail Pages
	•	Images should be center-aligned and limited in height (200–250px max)
	•	“Aantal”, “Maat”, “Bedieningszijde” fields must stack vertically
	•	All dropdowns and radios must be spaced correctly and touch-friendly
	•	Description box must collapse slightly or be scrollable if long
	7.	Footer
	•	Stack all footer info vertically
	•	Reduce font size to 12–13px on mobile
	•	Social media icons, address and contact details must stack and center
	8.	Global Adjustments
	•	Apply global padding for all mobile views: padding: 12px
	•	Use a fixed max-width for containers: 100% or 320–360px
	•	Avoid overflow content or elements wider than viewport
	•	Disable hover effects and ensure all interactions are touch-optimized
	9.	Scrolling Behavior
	•	Eliminate unnecessary white space
	•	Tighten layout so that a product list view shows at least 2 full product cards per screen on a phone

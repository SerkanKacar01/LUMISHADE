⸻

✅ Instruction Details:
	1.	Ensure full responsiveness site-wide
Go through all pages, sections, and components and verify that the layout responds perfectly on screens from 320px to 768px wide.
	2.	Use mobile-first design logic
Prioritize vertical stacking of elements, large tap targets, and content readability without zooming or side-scrolling.
	3.	Apply consistent padding and spacing
Ensure adequate white space around buttons, inputs, and text blocks on mobile. Use consistent spacing for better breathing room and focus.
	4.	Optimize font sizes for mobile
Adjust font sizes to remain easily legible on small screens. Headings should remain bold and clear, but not oversized.
	5.	Buttons and dropdowns

	•	Buttons must be large enough to tap with one finger (minimum height: 44px).
	•	Dropdowns must open cleanly and not overflow beyond the screen.
	•	Grid selectors (e.g., width options) must be converted to tap-friendly button grids.

	6.	Sticky mobile header or nav icon
Ensure the mobile menu is easily accessible with a hamburger menu icon. Keep the header fixed at the top on scroll for fast navigation access.
	7.	Images and containers
All images and product blocks must scale automatically and fit 100% width of their container on mobile.
	8.	Forms and inputs
Make sure all forms are touch-friendly, with clearly visible labels, large input fields, and easy-to-select options.
	9.	Test every page individually
Carefully test the homepage, product category pages, product detail pages, cart, and footer to verify each is fully functional and aesthetically clean on mobile.
	10.	Improve mobile footer behavior
Stack footer content logically. Keep contact info, payment logos, and navigation links readable and scrollable with clear hierarchy.
